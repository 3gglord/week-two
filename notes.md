## APIs
- worked well, no errors
- still need to get used to syntax and how to find out how APIs are formatted for specific databases

## OCR
- trouble installing the packages
- when I tried, I got this error message: 
- used [this website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27893230/installation-of-package-file-path-had-non-zero-exit-status-in-r) when I googled the error message
- tried to download https://community.rstudio.com/t/r-does-not-launch-properly/8630/2 
finally worked after downloading it again and following the instructions!

## bonus exercise
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58742620/ffmpeg-giving-me-failed-to-open-segment-error-trying-to-parse-wav-file-into-30
saw somebody's message in discord, saw that they had the same error as me and found Dr. Graham's solution to the problem two years ago: 
found [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGaw6VXV3GI) about managing anaconda environments and used it to deactive the current environment I was in then followed week two instructions to make a new environment
tried to redownload the requirements.txt info but I got these error messages:
looked up the error messages on google and downloaded the things I was missing
https://pypi.org/project/pytest-astropy/
https://pypi.org/project/pytest-filter-subpackage/
https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-server/
