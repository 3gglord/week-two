# Week two journal
- most of my failures this week seemed to be human errors, like when I didn't have the correct working directory in my terminal
- but, after encountering those problems I paid more attention to where I was entering my commands and used those early mistakes to troubleshoot other errors

## Reflection

who pays for work to end up online? Who does the work? What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? Where do you fit into this digital history machine?
